        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
          Tudela is a fifth class town and is one of the four municipalities in the Camotes group of islands. 
          The Camotes group, which includes the island of Leyte to the east, Cebu to the west and farther south, and Bohol, 
          is known for its rich cultural heritage and natural wonders. Camotes, especially Pilar Island, 
          is geographically closer to Ormoc City in Leyte than to Danao City in Cebu. 
          However, the entire Camotes group is administratively under Cebu Province and belongs to its fifth congressional district, 
          which also includes Danao City and the towns of Compostela, Carmen, and Sogod in the mainland.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tudela shares the island of Poro with the municipality of Poro, which was historically the mother town. 
          The other Camotes towns are San Francisco on Pacijan Island and Pilar on Ponson Island. 
          Tudela separated from Poro and was officially declared a town by the Spanish colonial government in 1892. 
          During the American colonial period, the two towns were briefly merged again but were finally separated in 1910.
        </p>

        <p>
          The name "Poro" is believed to have originated from the Waray word "puro," meaning "island" 
          (similar to "pulo" in Cebuano). This suggests that early settlers of Camotes may have come from Samar and parts of Leyte, 
          where Waray is spoken. Residents of Poro speak a unique language that is a blend of Waray, Ilonggo, Bol-anon, Cebuano, 
          and even Surigaonon, with distinct features like the use of the letter "z" in some words. 
          In contrast, Tudela residents primarily speak Cebuano.
        </p>

        <p>
          Historically, the area now known as Tudela’s poblacion was called Tag-anito, 
          a reference to the ancient practice of worshipping "anitos" or spirits. 
          When the area was declared a visita by the Spanish authorities, it retained this name until it was officially declared a town in May 1892. 
          In August of the same year, significant changes occurred under the guidance of Recollect priest Ramon.
